If you want to establish yourself as a front-end or a full-stack developer, you need to learn Angular.\n\nIf you've been confused or frustrated jumping from one Angular 4 tutorial to another, you've come to the right place.\u00a0In this course, Mosh,\u00a0author of several best-selling\u00a0courses on Udemy,\u00a0takes you on\u00a0a\u00a0fun\u00a0and pragmatic journey to master\u00a0Angular 4.\u00a0\n\nBy the end of watching this course, you'll be able to:\u00a0\n\n\nRight from the beginning, you'll jump in and build your first Angular app within minutes. Say goodbye to boring tutorials and courses with rambling instructors and\u00a0useless theories!\u00a0\n\nAngular 2+\u00a0has been written in TypeScript. So, in\u00a0section 2, you'll\u00a0learn the fundamentals of TypeScript and object-oriented programming to better understand and appreciate this powerful framework.\u00a0\n\nOver the next 8 hours, you'll learn the essentials of building client apps with Angular:\u00a0\n\nSo, if you're a busy developer with limited time and want to quickly learn how\u00a0to build and deploy client apps with Angular, you can stop here.\u00a0\n\nIf you're more adventurous\u00a0and want to learn more, there is far more content for you!\u00a0Over the following sections, you'll learn about more advanced topics:\u00a0\n\nAll that covers just over 21 hours of high-quality\u00a0content.\u00a0This is\u00a0equivalent to a book with more than a thousand pages!\u00a0But the kind of book that every line is worth reading, not a book that you want to skim!\u00a0If you have taken any of Mosh's courses before, you know he is very\u00a0clear and concise\u00a0in his teaching and doesn't waste a single minute of\u00a0your precious time!\n\nFinally, at the end of the course, you'll build and deploy a real-time e-commerce application with Angular 4, Firebase 4 and Bootstrap 4. This application exhibits patterns that you see in a lot of real-world applications:\n\nYou'll see how Mosh creates a brand new Angular project with Angular CLI\u00a0and builds this application from A\u00a0to Z, step-by-step. No copy/pasting! These 8.5 hours are packed with tips that you can only learn from a seasoned developer.\u00a0\n\nYou'll learn\u00a0how to\u00a0apply best practices,\u00a0refactor your code and produce high quality code like a professional developer. You'll learn\u00a0about Mosh's design decisions along the way and why he chooses a certain approach. What he shares with you comes from his 17 years\u00a0of\u00a0experience as a professional software developer.\u00a0\n\nYou're not going to get this information in other Angular courses out there!\u00a0\n\n\nAnd on top of all these, you'll get:\u00a0\n\n\nPREREQUISITES\nYou don't need familiarity with TypeScript or any previous versions of Angular.
